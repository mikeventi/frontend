						<p>No Mystery Studio is a Manhattan-based recording studio and multi-format
production house that was founded in 1989. Since its inception, No Mystery owner Aleks DeCarvalho has guided the creation of a staggering library of acclaimed musical and cinematic works including contributions to MTV, HBO and network series Point Break, Sex In The City, and numerous Grammy Award winning and multi-platinum artists. In 2007, Aleks partnered with Matthew Kemp, an artist manager and product launch specialist whose client network includes some of the most iconic names in the entertainment industry (Rakim, Alicia Keys, The Kinks, The Marleys, WuTang Clan, lggy Pop, Chrisette Michelle, among many others), to fortify and expand the No Mystery brand beyond the successful studio, and into the broader world of multi-format content production.</p>
						<p>While the entertainment marketplace is constantly shifting, the philosophy of
“content as the core” consistently stands true. No Mystery Studio embraces this
by first creating a superior foundation of product and then customizing it to
available outlets internationally, physically and virtually. Strategic alliances (and
options to merge or joint venture) with artist labels, advertising agencies, and
international distribution outlets. </p>
						<p>In 2009, the studio began production of a new film and music project entitled “Two Worlds” a look behind the personalities and processes of writing and recording that occurs when world renowned artists from vastly different musical genres and cultural backgrounds come together. The show will focus on marquee, globally recognized performers such as Rakim, The Marleys, Rammstein’s Richard Kruspe, virtuoso Joshua Bell, Aventura, Kid Rock and KRS-One amongst an ever expanding list in addition to some unknown “Stars of tomorrow” and the celebrities, industry impresarios and entourages that surround them.</p>
